Processed data, models and scripts to generate statistical models and figures for global prokaryote manuscript (currently under review at Nature Communications). Note this does not contain the climate data used in our analysis, which is too large for github. This data and additional scripts to calculate prokaryotic abundance, cell size, biomass at depth will be made freely available on publication of manuscript. Please contact Ryan for more information/early access.
